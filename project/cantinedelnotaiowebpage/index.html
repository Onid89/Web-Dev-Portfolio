            Cantina del Notaio, a distinguished winery nestled in the South of
            Italy, takes its name from a rich family history rooted in the legal
            profession. Founded by Gerardo Giuratrabocchetti, the winery pays
            homage to his father, who was a notary by profession. The choice of
            the name “Cantina del Notaio” reflects a deep connection to
            tradition and family legacy. In crafting exquisite wines, Cantina
            del Notaio draws inspiration not only from the fertile soil of the
            region but also from the values instilled by generations past. The
            notarial lineage symbolizes a commitment to precision, integrity and
            meticulous attention to detail, traits that seamlessly transfer from
            the legal profession to the art of winemaking. This unique
            combination of familial heritage and viticultural expertise results
            in wines that embody the essence of the land and carry forward a
            narrative that transcends generations. Cantina del Notaio invites
            wine enthusiasts to savor the fruits of a labor rooted in history,
            where the artistry of winemaking is intertwined with the legacy of a
            notary’s dedication and precision.

            The Aglianico grape has been well known since ancient Greek times.
            Celebrated by the Latin poet Horace, it is grown on the slopes of
            <!--I linked the word Monte Vulture to create a link to the wikipedia page for more info about-->

              >Monte Vulture</a
            >. And this is the origin of the three natural factors determining
            the constitution and ripening of these grapes. Firstly, the volcanic
            soil is fertile and rich in particular mineral elements. Then the
            tufo rock layers, deep down, act as water reservoirs during the
            drier periods of the year: what the local peasants call “milking the
            tufo”. Thirdly there is the unique micro-climate. The bunches of
            fruit are carefully selected and knowledgeably handled; they will
            yield a strong wine with a notable personality, precious ruby red
            color and complex aromas. For this reason, our Winery has paid
            especial attention to its choice of vineyards.

            The passion for winemaking is not new to the Giuratrabocchetti's
            family and has been handed down for generations. In 1998 the Cantine
            del Notaio wine estate was born from this same tradition, when both
            Gerardo Giuratrabocchetti and his wife Marcella, took up the
            Aglianico del Vulture challenge. They decided to combine tradition,
            innovation, history and terroir in the vines growing in their
            vineyards. Together with Luigi Moio, Full Professor of Enology at
            the University of Naples, they start a valuable collaboration and an
            extensive research on the winemaking potential of this grape, the
            most important in Southern Italy. A proud but difficult vine,
            capable of yielding wines with extraordinary personality
