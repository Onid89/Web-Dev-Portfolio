# My Project: Web-Dev Portfolio

# first Day: starting to use and play a bit with Bootstrap, I added a navigation bar, I searched for the perfect background image for my Portfolio on : https://unsplash.com/de . I thought about adding some effects for the title , and worked on how to make the text appear one letter at a time.

# Second Day: Working on the section About me , add a Background Video and working on text color .

# Third Day : Working again on the section About me and starting to add link .

# Fourth Day : Start to working on the Portfolio section, working on the position of the card , flexbox .

# Fifth Day : Creating the form with name , email and buttom and footer. Start working also on the Media Query.

# Sixth Day : working on the Portfolio Buttoms , add link and img on the card.

# Seventh Day : Trying to work againg on the form and make it responsive , changing some colors and position.

# Day Eight : working on the repository on github , pushing many times, cleaning a bit the project , and still working and trying to fix Media Query :( .
